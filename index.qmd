# Introduction to Reproducibility with R

Training for first year PhD students on the White Rose 
Universities (York, Sheffield, Leeds) DTP in Mechanistic Biology. 
It is designed and delivered by Emma Rand of The University of York.

## Overview

An increase in the complexity and scale of biological data means 
biologists are increasingly required to develop the data skills needed
to design reproducible workflows for the simulation, collection, 
organisation, processing, analysis and presentation of data. 
Developing such data skills requires at least some coding, also known 
as scripting. This makes your work (everything you do with your raw 
data) explicitly described, totally transparent and completely 
reproducible. However, learning to code can be a daunting prospect 
for many biologists! Thatâ€™s where an Reproducibility with R comes in!

R is a free and open source language especially well-suited to data 
analysis and visualisation and has a relatively inclusive and 
newbie-friendly community. R caters to users who do not see themselves 
as programmers, but then allows them to slide gradually into 
programming.

This workshop will introduce you to R and RStudio, the most widely
used interface for working with R. You will learn how to import data,
manipulate it, summarise it and plot it. You will how to use an
organised project-oriented workflow with well commented scripts
so that you can understand you work in the future and share it
with others. In addition, you will learn what a working directory and a 
file path are - these are key concepts in computing generally but ones
which are often not taught to biologists.


## Philosophy and approach

It is impossible to cover everything to you might ever need! 
Different people will use different methods and tools. Topics have 
been chosen because they are: foundational, widely applicable and 
transferable conceptually.



## Learning outcomes
After this workshop the successful learner will be able to:

-   Find their way around the RStudio windows
-   Create and plot data using ggplot
-   Explain the rationale for scripting analysis
-   Know how to load packages
-   Understand what is meant by the working directory, absolute and 
    relative paths and be able to apply these concepts to data import
-   Summarise data in a single group or in multiple groups
-   Develop highly organised analyses including well-commented scripts 
    that can be understood by future you and others
